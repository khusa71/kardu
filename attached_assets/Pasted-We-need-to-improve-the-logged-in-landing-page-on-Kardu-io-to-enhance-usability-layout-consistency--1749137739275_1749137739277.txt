We need to improve the logged-in landing page on Kardu.io to enhance usability, layout consistency, and user clarity. Please review and implement the following:

✅ 1. Footer & Layout Fixes
The footer is missing on the landing page after login—this needs to be consistently visible across all pages.

There is no horizontal padding on the page—content is pushed to the edges. Add left/right padding to maintain a clean layout and avoid visual crowding.

✅ 2. Pricing Card Logic
The pricing card does not reflect the user's current plan. For Pro users:

Hide or disable the “Upgrade to Pro” button.

Display a clear message like: “You’re on the Pro Plan”.

Optionally add a link to “Manage Subscription” or show usage limits.

✅ 3. Content Structure Enhancements
We have limited content right now, but we need to make it visually impactful. Apply the following UI principles:

Clean Typography Hierarchy: Use large, bold headers (text-7xl) to convey value.

Minimal, Professional Design: Stick to white backgrounds, subtle grays, and a restrained accent color palette.

Clear Navigation: Use well-spaced, hover-friendly header items like:
Home | Upload | History | Study | Admin | Logout

Strong CTAs: Prominent, high-contrast buttons like “Start Creating Flashcards” with good spacing and hover effects.

Centered, Focused Layout: Avoid edge-to-edge content blocks—center the main sections with comfortable margins and padding.

✅ 4. Mobile-First Implementation
Prioritize mobile usability from the start:

Stack sections vertically.

Responsive typography and buttons.

Collapsible/hamburger menu for navigation.

Cards and CTA buttons sized for touch.

✅ 5. Future Enhancements (Optional Now, But Good to Prepare For)
Add sample flashcard previews to visually show the product’s value.

Include a simple FAQ or "How it Works" section with visuals.

Integrate testimonials or student use cases.

Consider tracking upload usage on dashboard.

Add basic analytics (e.g., Google Analytics or Plausible).
