Please validate that the entire flashcard generation platform is functioning correctly across all key features, both backend and frontend. Test the following:

PDF Upload Handling

Upload both text-based and scanned PDFs

Verify OCR activates for scanned files (check confidence score)

Confirm headers/footers/page numbers are removed

Flashcard Generation

Ensure AI model (OpenAI/Anthropic) generates subject-relevant flashcards

Validate cards include concepts, definitions, examples, and procedures

Confirm difficulty tagging (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced) works

Cost Optimization

Upload the same file twice and check for cache hit

Ensure logs or UI show estimated tokens and cost saved

Verify smart chunking and token minimization are effective

Flashcard Editor & Study Mode

Test flashcard preview, drag-and-drop, and real-time editing

Launch study mode, mark progress (New/Learning/Known), and verify analytics

Confirm spaced repetition algorithm and custom session sizing work

Export Functionality

Download flashcards in Anki (.apkg), CSV, JSON, and Quizlet format

Verify data is intact in each export

User Authentication & Quota System

Register/login/logout workflows

Check upload quota enforcement for free/pro accounts

Test upgrade flow and plan management

User Feedback & Real-Time Status

When generating flashcards, ensure visual feedback appears:

Loading spinners

Status messages (“Extracting…”, “Generating…”)

Button disables to prevent repeat clicks

Verify proper handling of failures and error messages

Mobile UX & PWA Support

Confirm responsive design on mobile/tablet/desktop

Test installability as a Progressive Web App

Toggle dark/light themes and confirm UI consistency

Analytics & Monitoring

Confirm visibility into:

OCR usage

Token savings

Upload history

Study performance

Quota tracking

Security & Stability

Handle corrupted PDF uploads gracefully

Verify temp files are cleaned up

Ensure JWT/session auth behaves correctly

Log and report any broken features or missing UI feedback. If all pass, confirm that the system provides a seamless and cost-optimized learning experience from PDF to interactive study.
