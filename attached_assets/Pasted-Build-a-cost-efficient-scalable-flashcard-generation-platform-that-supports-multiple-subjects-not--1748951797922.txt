Build a cost-efficient, scalable flashcard generation platform that supports multiple subjects (not just Python), leverages OCR for scanned documents, and optimizes LLM/API usage through smart preprocessing, embeddings, and reusable components.

‚úÖ Functional Requirements (User-Facing)
Upload PDFs from any subject (support text + scanned PDFs).

Automatically extract content (via OCR if necessary).

Generate high-quality flashcards using an LLM.

Preview, edit, and export flashcards (Anki .apkg, Quizlet, CSV).

Track user progress and provide spaced repetition schedules.

Provide mobile-friendly interface + offline access.

Allow deck sharing and collaborative editing.

Offer summary/highlight features from PDFs.

üí∞ Optimization & Cost Efficiency Strategies
1. Efficient LLM Usage
Chunk & Classify First: Use a lightweight model (e.g., gpt-3.5-turbo or local model like mistral-7b) to classify or filter relevant sections before sending to GPT-4.

Use Templates: Create standardized prompts that minimize tokens while extracting max value from LLM calls.

Batch Processing: Process multiple flashcards in one call to reduce overhead.

Caching: Store processed sections (via hash or UUID) to avoid regenerating cards from the same content.

2. Preprocessing Pipeline (Smart Content Handling)
Text-first approach: Use PyMuPDF and fallback to OCR only if needed.

OCR (fallback only): Use pytesseract for basic OCR or easyocr for low-cost multilingual OCR.

Page classification: Identify whether a page is scanned (image) or text-based to skip unnecessary OCR.

3. Embedding & Vector Storage (LLM Offloading)
Use embeddings (via OpenAI, Cohere, or open-source models like Instructor XL) to:

Store and reuse card-worthy chunks.

Enable semantic search for reviewing past uploads.

Store embeddings in a vector DB (e.g., FAISS, Weaviate, or Qdrant) to:

Reduce API calls when content is similar.

Power recommendation systems (e.g., ‚ÄúGenerate cards from related topics‚Äù).

4. Freemium Monetization Model
Free tier: Text-based PDFs, limit LLM calls/month, limited export.

Pro tier: Full OCR support, priority card generation, analytics dashboard, more export formats.

Implement LLM credit tracking internally to manage user quota.

5. Lightweight Infrastructure
Backend: FastAPI (async, efficient), deployed on Fly.io, Render, or AWS Lambda for burst loads.

Frontend: React + Tailwind + PWA features for mobile use/offline mode.

Storage: Use S3-compatible object storage (e.g., Cloudflare R2, Wasabi) for uploaded files.
