1. Hero Section — Bold First Impression
	•	Black grid background (subtle, modern tech look)
	•	Large bold H1:
“Turn any PDF into smart flashcards — in seconds.”
	•	Subheadline: Short benefit-led line, e.g.
“AI-powered spaced repetition to help you learn faster, retain longer.”
	•	Two CTAs:
→ Start Free Trial (primary)
→ Watch Demo (secondary)
	•	✨ Optional detail: Minimal animation in the background grid (floating points, pulsating dots)

2. “Who Is It For?” — Auto-Toggling Personas

A horizontal section right below the hero

	•	Toggleable persona buttons (e.g., tabs or ghost buttons):
🎓 Student | 📝 Exam Prepper | 👨‍💼 Professional | 🧠 Lifelong Learner
	•	When toggled:
	•	Smoothly fades in a matching mini-illustration or icon + short blurb
	•	Example:
“As a student, you can turn dense PDFs into bite-sized recall prompts, and crush your finals 2x faster.”
	•	Keep it minimal, animated using framer-motion or CSS fade/slide

3. Spaced Repetition Explanation (with Retention Graph)

Clean, educational — but conversion-aware

	•	Section title:
“Smarter Studying Through Spaced Repetition”
	•	Left: 1–2 sentence explanation of the method

(Graph animates on scroll using IntersectionObserver)

“StudyCards AI adapts this model for your content and recall pace.”

🧑‍💻 Interaction & Visual Style Guidelines
	•	Strict black-and-white theme
	•	Add 1 accent gradient color sparingly (CTAs, H1 highlights)
	•	Notion-style font scale and padding
	•	Clear hierarchy, whitespace-rich layout
	•	Smooth scroll animations using IntersectionObserver
	•	Bento-style layout only if reused in the hero or animation, but not in separate sections
	•	Micro-interactions: button hover, toggle slide, graph animate on scroll
	•	Use framer-motion, tailwindcss, and next/image for performance
