Add Remaining Features to Complete Flashcard Generation Platform
Objective:
Enhance the flashcard platform with user interaction, spaced repetition, mobile support, account systems, and monetization features—while maintaining cost efficiency and scalability.

✅ Existing Features (Already Implemented)
OCR support for scanned PDFs with auto-detection and confidence scoring

Smart caching to reduce API calls and minimize costs

LLM-based content filtering and batching

Multi-format export: Anki, CSV, JSON, Quizlet

Real-time cost estimation

Multi-subject flashcard support (10+ categories)

🚀 Features to Add
1. 📋 Flashcard Preview & Edit Interface
Allow users to:

View generated flashcards before export

Edit question or answer text

Delete cards

Reorder cards

Key UI needs:

Scrollable list of flashcards

In-place editing using input fields or modals

Save changes to updated deck export

2. 🧠 Spaced Repetition & Progress Tracking
Add lightweight study mode with:

Status tags: "New", "Learning", "Known"

Optional interval scheduling based on review behavior

Visual progress: deck completion %, pie charts, etc.

Optional:
Support Anki-compatible intervals and card statuses

3. 👤 User Accounts & Deck History
Let users:

Sign up/sign in (Google OAuth or email/password)

Store uploaded PDFs and generated decks

View deck history and re-download past decks

Track LLM usage/credit quota

Backend considerations:

Use PostgreSQL or Firebase for auth + storage

Link decks to user profiles

Track per-user API usage (for freemium model)

4. 💸 Freemium Model & Billing
Support a usage-limited free tier and paid Pro tier with:

Monthly quotas (e.g., 3 PDF uploads/month for free users)

Pro perks: faster processing, larger PDFs, full OCR access, unlimited exports

Stripe or Paddle integration for subscription management

UX Ideas:

Show remaining quota on dashboard

Prompt upgrade at limit

5. 📱 Mobile-First UI & Offline Mode
Ensure:

Fully responsive web interface

PWA support for offline access to decks

LocalStorage to cache decks for offline review

6. 🌍 Deck Sharing & Community
Enable:

Publishing of flashcard decks (with tags and descriptions)

Public search/discovery UI

“Duplicate this deck” functionality

Optional: Likes, comments, download count

Backend:

Add public/private flag to decks

Search index by subject and keyword

🧩 Optional Bonus Features
Text-to-Speech for flashcard reading

Multilingual support (OCR + translation)

“Performance Mode” toggle: cheap vs high-quality LLM output

🧠 Optimization Guidance (Do Not Skip)
Use embeddings and vector DB (e.g., FAISS) to avoid reprocessing similar inputs

Use content hashing to identify duplicate pages or documents

Prioritize cheaper LLMs (e.g., gpt-3.5-turbo, mistral) for bulk tasks and summaries
