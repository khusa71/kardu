Analyze the entire codebase of the Smart Flashcard Generator project to evaluate its feature set, monetization readiness, and user value proposition.

üìö Project Summary (Reference Only)
The app turns PDFs into interactive flashcards using GPT-4o and Claude. It features a TypeScript/React frontend and an Express backend with Firebase Auth, PostgreSQL (via Drizzle ORM), Replit Object Storage, and Stripe for payments.
Key components include AI generation, OCR/PDF parsing, export options (Anki, CSV, JSON, Quizlet), a flashcard study mode, editor, and user role-based upload limits.

‚úÖ Tasks for You:
Codebase Audit (Frontend & Backend)

List all implemented features.

Identify which features are functional, partially broken, or missing entirely.

Evaluate Paid-Feature Justification ($9/month)
Determine which features are strong enough to justify a $9/month subscription:

AI Flashcard Generation (Custom Subject + Difficulty + Context)

Reusable Uploaded Files

Study Mode (Progress Tracking + Editing)

Export Formats (Anki, CSV, JSON, Quizlet)

Premium Limits (1 vs 10 file uploads, 10MB caps)

Responsive UI across devices

Admin Dashboard (if accessible)

Identify Feature Gaps or Broken UX

Study center not showing past-generated flashcards?

Flashcard editing not working in upload history or study interface?

Missing or non-functional buttons in mobile view (e.g., navigation, reuse file)?

Admin panel lacks backend data hooks or role-based protection?

Give a Monetization Verdict

Is this app in its current state ready for monetization at $9/month?

If not, what is the minimum viable set of features and polish needed to confidently charge users?
