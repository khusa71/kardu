## Business Logic & Rules

### Upload Quota System
```typescript
// Quota enforcement logic
Free Users: 3 uploads/month, resets monthly
Premium Users: 100 uploads/month, resets monthly
Page Limits: Free (50 pages), Premium (200 pages)
Historical Reprocessing: Doesn't count against quota
```

### AI Model Selection
```typescript
// Tier-based AI access
Basic Quality: Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Free + Premium)
Advanced Quality: OpenAI GPT-4o (Premium only)
Admin Configurable: Models can be changed via admin panel
```

### Spaced Repetition Algorithm
```typescript
// Learning progression logic
Card States: New → Learning → Reviewing → Known
Intervals: 1 day → 3 days → 1 week → 2 weeks → 1 month → 6 months
Difficulty Adjustment: Based on user performance and self-rating
Success Criteria: 3 consecutive correct answers to reach "Known" status
```

### File Processing Pipeline
```typescript
// Processing workflow
1. Upload Validation (size, type, virus scan)
2. Text Extraction (PyMuPDF for digital, Tesseract for scanned)
3. Content Preprocessing (relevance scoring, section detection)
4. AI Generation (chunked processing with retry logic)
5. Flashcard Storage (normalized database with individual records)
6. Export Generation (on-demand with 1-hour expiry)
```
