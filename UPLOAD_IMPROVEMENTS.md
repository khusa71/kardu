# Upload Page Improvement Analysis & Implementation Plan

## Current Issues Identified

### 1. Authentication & Token Management (Critical)
- **Problem**: 401 "No token provided" errors during job polling
- **Impact**: Users stuck on processing screen when tokens expire
- **Root Cause**: React Query polling continues after token expiry
- **Solution**: Implement token refresh mechanism and authentication error recovery

### 2. Performance & Memory Issues (High Priority)
- **Problem**: High memory usage (269MB) and excessive debug logging
- **Impact**: Server performance degradation and resource waste
- **Root Cause**: Debug console.log statements and no cleanup between uploads
- **Solution**: Remove debug logs, implement memory cleanup, optimize polling

### 3. User Experience Gaps (Medium-High Priority)
- **Problem**: No real-time progress feedback, complex configuration
- **Impact**: Poor user experience, confusion during processing
- **Root Cause**: Basic progress tracking, overwhelming configuration options
- **Solution**: Enhanced progress visualization, simplified configuration flow

### 4. UI Layout & Design (Medium Priority)
- **Problem**: Configuration complexity, limited preview functionality
- **Impact**: Cognitive overhead, reduced conversion rates
- **Root Cause**: Complex tabbed interface, minimal flashcard preview
- **Solution**: Streamlined interface, enhanced preview experience
