JavaScript Fundamentals

Variables in JavaScript are used to store data values. There are three ways to declare variables:

1. let - for variables that can change
2. const - for constants that cannot change  
3. var - older way of declaring variables

Functions are blocks of code designed to perform specific tasks. They can take parameters and return values.

Example:
function greet(name) {
    return "Hello " + name;
}

Arrays store multiple values in a single variable:
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];

Objects store key-value pairs:
let person = {
    name: "John",
    age: 30
};
