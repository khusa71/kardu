      "question": "What is a variable in programming?",
      "answer": "A variable is a named storage location that holds data values. It can be assigned different values during program execution. Example: x = 10",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between '=' and '==' operators in Python?",
      "answer": "'=' is the assignment operator used to assign values to variables. '==' is the equality comparison operator used to check if two values are equal. Example: x = 5 (assignment), x == 5 (comparison)",

      "question": "What is a loop in programming?",
      "answer": "A loop is a programming construct that repeats a block of code multiple times until a specified condition is met. Common types include for loops and while loops.",

    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of indentation in Python?",
      "answer": "Indentation in Python is used to define code blocks and structure. It determines which statements belong together in functions, loops, and conditional statements. Python uses 4 spaces per indentation level.",

      "question": "What is a string in programming?",

    {
      "question": "What is an algorithm?",
      "answer": "An algorithm is a step-by-step set of instructions or rules designed to solve a specific problem or perform a particular task. It's like a recipe that computers follow to process data.",

      "difficulty": "beginner"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between a syntax error and a logic error?",
      "answer": "A syntax error occurs when code doesn't follow proper language rules (e.g., missing colon). A logic error occurs when code runs but produces incorrect results due to flawed reasoning in the algorithm.",
