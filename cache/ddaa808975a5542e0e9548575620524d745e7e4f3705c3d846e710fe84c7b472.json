      "question": "What ions do acids contain, and provide an example with the specific ions present?",
      "answer": "Acids contain H+ ions as cations and various anions. For example:\n- HCl contains H+ cations and Cl- anions\n- HNO3 contains H+ cations and NO3- anions",

      "question": "What is a neutralization reaction and why is it important in chemistry?",
      "answer": "A neutralization reaction occurs when an acid reacts with a base (alkali) to form salt and water. The reaction neutralizes both the acidic and basic properties, resulting in a more neutral pH. This is important for controlling acidity in various applications.",

      "question": "What is the chlor-alkali process and why is it industrially significant?",
      "answer": "The chlor-alkali process is an industrial method that produces important chemicals from common salt (sodium chloride). It generates sodium hydroxide, chlorine gas, and hydrogen gas, which are raw materials for manufacturing various everyday products like baking soda and washing soda.",

      "question": "Why do compounds like alcohols and glucose contain hydrogen but are not classified as acids?",
      "answer": "Although alcohols and glucose contain hydrogen atoms, they do not release H+ ions when dissolved in water. Acids must be able to donate H+ ions (protons) in solution to exhibit acidic properties. The hydrogen in alcohols and glucose is covalently bonded and not readily ionizable.",

      "question": "What does it mean for chemical compounds to 'belong to a family' and provide an example?",
      "answer": "Chemical compounds belong to a family when they share similar chemical properties or contain the same type of ions. For example, NaCl (sodium chloride) and Na2SO4 (sodium sulfate) belong to the same family because they both contain sodium (Na+) ions, making them sodium salts.",

      "question": "How can you test for the presence of acids using natural materials?",
      "answer": "You can test for acids using natural indicators:\n1. Red cabbage leaves - turn red/pink in acidic solutions\n2. Turmeric - changes color in basic solutions (remains yellow in acidic)\n3. Flower petals (Petunia, Hydrangea) - change color based on pH\nThese materials contain compounds that change color in response to H+ ion concentration.",
