But as you will\nsee in this chapter, the making of the global world has a long\nhistory – of trade, of migration, of people in search of work, the\nmovement of capital, and much else. As we think about the dramatic\nand visible signs of global interconnectedness in our lives today,\nwe need to understand the phases through which this world in\nwhich we live has emerged.\nAll through history, human societies have become steadily more\ninterlinked. From ancient times, travellers, traders, priests and\npilgrims travelled vast distances for knowledge, opportunity and\nspiritual fulfilment, or to escape persecution. They carried goods,\nmoney, values, skills, ideas, inventions, and even germs and diseases.\nAs early as 3000 BCE an active coasta",
